            Modern Indian cuisine has its basis in the 5,000 year history of the country, shaped by regional, cultural, and colonial influences. The food of India is as incredibly diverse as the languages, people, traditions, and customs from across its vast heartland.

            Nirmal’s is the culmination of a life long dream and desire of owners Oliver and Gita Bangera to showcase the true diversity of Indian cuisine. The focus at Nirmal’s is bringing authentic preparations but representing diverse regions of India. In the process Oliver and Gita wanted to expose and excite customers with a surprising array of never before seen dishes and preparation styles, thus living up to Nirmal’s core idea and philosophy of “Indian cuisine, Re-imagined!”.
